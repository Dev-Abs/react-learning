// UseContext Hook, explain? , useContext is a hook that allows you to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.
// useContext(MyContext) only lets you read the context and subscribe to its changes. You still need a <MyContext.Provider> above in the tree to provide the value for this context.
// useContext(MyContext) is equivalent to static contextType = MyContext in a class, or <MyContext.Consumer>.
import React from 'react'

const UseContext = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default UseContext
