// useRef Hook, explain
// useRef Hook is used to create mutable references that persist for the entire lifetime of the component.
// It is a function that returns a mutable object with a current property that can be used to store values.
// The value of the current property can be changed without triggering a re-render of the component.
// useRef is commonly used to access DOM elements, store previous values, and create timers or intervals.
// It is similar to the ref attribute in class components, but can be used in functional components.
// The useRef Hook is a close replacement for the ref attribute in class components.
