// Use Callback Hook
// useCallback Hook is used to memoize a function and cache the result to avoid unnecessary re-creation of the function.
// It is a function that takes a function and an array of dependencies, and returns the memoized function.
// The memoized function is only re-created when the dependencies change.
// useCallback is useful for optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary re-creations of functions.

// difference between useMemo and useCallback
// useMemo is used to memoize the result of a function, while useCallback is used to memoize the function itself.
